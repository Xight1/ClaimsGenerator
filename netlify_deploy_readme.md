# Claims Generator v2026-06-03 - Beta 1

A small static web app for generating claim email text and subjects.

## Overview

  css/
  js/
netlify.toml

## Recent Changes: Performance & DOM Cache (2026-06-02)

To improve runtime responsiveness and reduce redundant DOM lookups, a small DOM caching helper was added to `assets/js/config.js`.

What was added

- A lightweight DOM cache populated on `DOMContentLoaded` with frequently used element IDs (subjectOutput, emailOutput, formContainer, senderName, claimType, and others).
- Two small helpers exposed on `window`: `cacheDOM(ids)` and `getCached(id)`.

Why this helps

- Repeated calls to `document.getElementById` are avoided in hot code paths, which reduces lookup overhead and improves responsiveness when the preview updates frequently while typing.

Next recommended changes (planned)

1. Update hot code paths (`assets/js/app.js`, `assets/js/performance.js`, `assets/js/navigation.js`) to use `getCached` and centralize the requestAnimationFrame scheduling.
2. Batch DOM writes using DocumentFragment when rebuilding the form to avoid layout thrash.
3. Memoize expensive formatters (toLocaleString / toLocaleDateString) to avoid repeated work.
4. Move duplicated utility helpers (like `addDays`) into a single `assets/js/utils.js` and import them where needed.
5. Add linting and small unit tests for pure helpers (currency parsing, date helpers) to prevent regressions.

If you want, I can implement the RAF unification and the remaining hot-path changes next.
